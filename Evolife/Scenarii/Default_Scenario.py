""" @brief  Determines how individuals acquire their score, either by themselves or through interactions.

	Evolife scenarii may rewrite several functions defined here :
	(those marked with '+' are called from 'Group.py')
	(those marked with 'o' are called from 'Observer.py')

	- initialization(self): allows to define local variables
	- genemap(self):	initialises the genes on the gene map (see 'Genetic_map.py')
	- phenemap(self):   defines a list of phenotypic character names (see 'Phenotype.py')
	+ season(self, year, members):   makes periodic actions like resetting parameters
	+ behaviour(self, BestIndiv, AvgIndiv):   defines a behaviour to be displayed
	+ life_game(self, members): defines a round of interactions - calls the five following functions
		- start_game(self, members):	group-level initialization before starting interactions
			- prepare(self, indiv): individual initialization before starting interactions
		- interaction(self, Indiv, Partner):	defines a single interaction 
			- partner(self, Indiv, members):	select a partner among 'members' that will interact with 'Indiv'
		- end_game(self, members):  an occasion for a closing round after all interactions
		- evaluation(self, Indiv):  defines how the score of an individual is computed
		- lives(self, members): converts scores into life points
	+ couples(self, members): returns a list of couples for procreation (individuals may appear in several couples!)- Calls the following functions:
		- parenthood(self, RankedCandidates, Def_Nb_Children):	Determines the number of children depending on rank
		- parents(self, candidates):	selects two parents from a list of candidates (candidate = (indiv, NbOfPotentialChildren))
	+ new_agent(self, child, parents): initializes newborns
	+ remove_agent(self, agent): action to be performed when an agent dies
	+ update_positions(self, members, groupID):	assigns a position to agents
	o default_view(self): says which windows should be open at start up
	o legends(self): returns a string to be displayed at the bottom ot the Legend window.
	o display_(self):   says which statistics are displayed each year
	o def Field_grid(self):	initial draw in the Field window
	o def Trajectory_grid(self):	initial draw in the Trajectory window
	o wallpaper(self, Window):	if one wants to display different backgrounds in windows
